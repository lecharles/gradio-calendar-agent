# Meeting Rescheduler Agent â€” Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the Meeting Rescheduler Agent, a chatbot-based tool to help users efficiently manage and reschedule meetings when planning time off. The document is intended for developers, designers, stakeholders, and testers involved in the project.

### 1.2 Scope
The application will:
- Integrate with a user's personal Gmail account to access Google Calendar and Gmail APIs.
- Allow users to cancel recurring meetings and send personalized emails for one-off meetings during a specified time off period.
- Provide all interactions through a conversational chatbot interface (Gradio chatbot component).

**Out of Scope:**
- Rescheduling meetings to new dates (initial version will only cancel or notify).
- Bulk editing of meetings outside the specified time off period.
- Support for non-Gmail accounts (initial version).
- Any traditional or graphical user interface outside the chatbot.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- **Primary:** Developers, designers, and testers building the application.
- **Secondary:** Stakeholders and end users interested in the application's capabilities.

### 1.4 Definitions and Acronyms
- **OAuth2:** Open standard for access delegation, used for secure API authentication.
- **API:** Application Programming Interface.
- **Gmail API:** Google API for sending and managing emails.
- **Google Calendar API:** Google API for managing calendar events.
- **Chatbot:** Conversational interface for user interaction.
- **Recurring Meeting:** A calendar event that repeats on a regular schedule.
- **One-off Meeting:** A calendar event that occurs only once.

## 3. User Stories / Use Cases

### 3.1 User Stories
- As a user, I want to connect my Gmail account so that the agent can access my calendar and email.
- As a user, I want to specify my time off dates so that the agent can find meetings to manage.
- As a user, I want the agent to automatically cancel all recurring meetings during my time off so that I don't have to do it manually.
- As a user, I want to review one-off meetings and send personalized emails to attendees so that I can communicate my absence.
- As a user, I want to confirm all actions before they are performed so that I remain in control.

### 3.2 Use Case Example
**Use Case Name:** Cancel Recurring Meetings and Notify One-off Attendees
- **Actors:** User (authenticated Gmail account), Meeting Rescheduler Agent
- **Preconditions:** User is authenticated with Gmail; time off dates are provided.
- **Basic Flow:**
  1. User connects Gmail account via OAuth2.
  2. User specifies time off dates in chat.
  3. Agent retrieves all meetings in the period.
  4. Agent cancels recurring meetings and confirms with user.
  5. Agent lists one-off meetings; user customizes and sends emails.
  6. Agent confirms completion.
- **Alternative Flows:**
  - User cancels the operation at any step.
  - API errors or permission issues are surfaced in chat.
- **Postconditions:** All recurring meetings are cancelled; emails sent for one-off meetings.
