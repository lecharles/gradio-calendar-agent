# Implementation Plan â€” Meeting Rescheduler Agent

This plan breaks down the project into actionable steps, each with checkboxes for tracking progress. Each section is designed to be completed in a single chat session by a coding agent.

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] Create and activate a Python virtual environment  
    _Completed: gradio_venv created and activated._
- [x] Install required dependencies (Gradio, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google APIs, etc.)  
    _Completed: All dependencies installed in gradio_venv._
- [ ] Initialize project structure and version control

## 2. Authentication (Gmail OAuth2)
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud project and enable Gmail/Calendar APIs
- [ ] Implement OAuth2 authentication flow for Gmail
- [ ] Test authentication and token handling in a local environment

## 3. Calendar Integration
- [ ] Connect to Google Calendar API
- [ ] Retrieve all events for a user-specified date range
- [ ] Classify events as recurring or one-off
- [ ] Unit test event retrieval and classification

## 4. Recurring Meetings Management
- [ ] Implement logic to cancel recurring meetings in the specified period
- [ ] Optionally, send cancellation notifications to attendees
- [ ] Confirm cancellations with the user in the chatbot

## 5. One-off Meetings Management
- [ ] List all one-off meetings in the chat for user review
- [ ] Provide suggested email templates for each one-off meeting
- [ ] Allow user to customize and send emails to attendees via Gmail API

## 6. Chatbot Interface (Gradio)
- [ ] Set up Gradio chatbot component as the main UI
- [ ] Implement conversational flow for:
  - [ ] Authentication
  - [ ] Time off input
  - [ ] Meeting review and actions
  - [ ] Email customization and sending
  - [ ] Error and confirmation messages

## 7. Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Implement user-facing error messages in chat
- [ ] Add internal logging for debugging (no user data stored)
- [ ] Handle API failures and allow retry

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Ensure secure handling of credentials and tokens
- [ ] Make chatbot interface accessible (keyboard, screen reader)
- [ ] Follow PEP8 and code quality standards

## 9. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for all major functions
- [ ] Write integration tests for API interactions (mocked)
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing

## 10. Deployment and Release
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts/configuration for cloud platform
- [ ] Deploy Gradio app to cloud (Heroku, AWS, or GCP)
- [ ] Verify deployment and run smoke tests

## 11. Documentation and Training
- [ ] Write user onboarding instructions (chatbot walkthrough)
- [ ] Add developer documentation to the repo
- [ ] Document change management and support procedures

## 12. Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Add support for Outlook and other providers
- [ ] Implement meeting rescheduling (not just cancellation)
- [ ] Add localization for other languages
- [ ] Add persistent user preferences
